We can improve quality (read- conformance to specification) by introducing an inspection stage in our process.
Clearly, a full inspection is time consuming. 
It may also be destructive (you don't want to re-package ice-cream after checking its texture \dots).
No-inspection may be appropriate if you don't particularly care about your brand, or if production has very high capability indices.
A reasonable, intermediate approach, is a partial random inspection, known as \emph{acceptance sampling}.
As the name suggests, in acceptance sampling, one samples, then checks, then accepts (or not).

Acceptance sampling can be seen as a control chart monitoring that triggers active intervention in the production. As such ,it is a crude type of \emph{engineering control} (Sec.~\ref{sec:terminology_statistical}).
The intervention is obvious. The monitoring is based on some continuous (variable) or discrete (attribute) of a sample of units from a \emph{batch}, \aka, a \emph{lot}.
Seen as a feedback control, it is not surprising that when designing an acceptance sampling scheme, we have similar decisions as when designing a control chart:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is a batch? Just like choosing the sampling frequency in a Shewart chart. 
We would like homogenous batches, i.e., with low inner variability. A box, a shipment, a day's production, are typical batches. 
\item Within batch sampling scheme: just like rational grouping in Shewart chart. Typical approaches include \emph{single sampling plans}, \emph{double}, \emph{multiple}, and \emph{sequential sampling plans}.
This can be seen as the design of an experiment to be performed on each batch.
\item How many units? Just like choosing the sample size in a Shewart chart.
\item Decision cutoff: Just like setting control limits in a Shewart chart. 
\end{enumerate}
We can readily see that the design of an acceptance sampling scheme is very similar to the design of a control chart. 
We may construct an full blown economical optimization problem to design the sampling, as we did in Section~\ref{sec:economical_considerations}. Just like control charts, however, it is more common to design sampling schemes using ``first-order'' power considerations. 
For this reason, the \emph{power function} will play a crucial role.

\section{Acceptance Sampling Terminology}
Adapted from \cite{natrella_nist/sematech_2010}.
\begin{description}
\item [LASP] A \emph{lot acceptance sampling plan}, ultimately, a statistical test at the end of which we either accept a batch. In this text we typically use the \emph{batch acceptance sampling scheme} for the same purpose. 
\item [AQL] The \emph{acceptable quality level}, or \emph{acceptable quality limit}, is the highest proportion of defects acceptable to the producer. 
\item [LTPD] The \emph{lot tolerance percent defective} is the highest proportion of defects acceptable to the consumer. Clearly, $AQL<LTPD$. LTPD is also known as \emph{rejectable quality level} (RQL), and \emph{ limiting quality level} (LQL). 
\item [OC Curve] The \emph{operating characteristic curve} is the power function of an LSAP.
\item [Type-A and Type-B OC Curves] A \emph{Type-A OC curve} is one computed assuming sampling from batches is done without replacement. Conversely, a \emph{Type-B OC curve} is computed assuming sampling with replacement.
\item [Producer's Risk] The \emph{producer's risk} is throwing away good batches. Formally, this is the probability of rejecting a batch with less than AQL defects. We consider there type-I errors.
\item [Consumer's Risk] The \emph{consumer's risk} is accepting bad batches. Formally, this is the probability of accepting a batch with more than LTPD defects. We consider there type-II errors.
\item [Rectifying Inspection] An LASP where lots are not rejected but rather rectified. 
\item [AOQ] The \emph{average outgoing quality}, as the name suggests, is the average proportion of defects after a rectifying inspection has been introduced in the process. 
\item [AOQL] The \emph{average outgoing quality level} is the (unknown) defect proportion that would return the worst AOQ after a rectifying inspection.
\item [ATI] The \emph{average total inspection}, as the name suggests, is the average number of units inspected in a batch.
\end{description}



\section{Single Sampling Scheme}
In the simplest LASP we base our decisions on a single random sample from each batch.
This obviously facilitates the statistical analysis of the properties of this LASP.

When sampling $n$ units from a batch with a proportion of $p$ defects, then the number of defects $\x \sim Binom(n,p)$.
If we reject a batch when more than $c$ defects are found, then the power function of a type-B LASP is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:power_accpet}
	\pi_{n,c}(p)=P(\x \geq c)= \sum_{k=c}^n \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{1-k} .
\end{align}
Eq.(\ref{eq:power_accpet}) may be evaluated manually, or with the \rcode{pbinom()} \R function. 

Just like any other hypothesis test, it is common practice to set $n,c$ so that control both the consumer's risk ($\beta=1-\pi$) and the producer's risk ($\alpha$).
