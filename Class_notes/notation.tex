\chapter{Notation}
\label{apx:notation}

In this text we use the following notation conventions:
\begin{description}
\item[$x$] A vector (or scalar). It is typically a column vector, but this should typically be implied from the text.
\item[$:=$] An assignment, or definition: $A:=a$ means that $A$ is defined to be $a$. 
\item[$\prod_{i=1}^{n}$] The product operator: $\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i:= x_1 \times \dots \times x_n$
\item[$\#\set{A}$] The count operator. Returns the number of elements of the set $A$. Also known as the \emph{cardinality}.

\end{description}
