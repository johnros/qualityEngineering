	isbn = {978-1-4398-4799-2},
	abstract = {A major tool for quality control and management, statistical process control (SPC) monitors sequential processes, such as production lines and Internet traffic, to ensure that they work stably and satisfactorily. Along with covering traditional methods, Introduction to Statistical Process Control describes many recent SPC methods that improve upon the more established techniques. The author—a leading researcher on SPC—shows how these methods can handle new applications.  After exploring the role of SPC and other statistical methods in quality control and management, the book covers basic statistical concepts and methods useful in SPC. It then systematically describes traditional SPC charts, including the Shewhart, CUSUM, and EWMA charts, as well as recent control charts based on change-point detection and fundamental multivariate SPC charts under the normality assumption. The text also introduces novel univariate and multivariate control charts for cases when the normality assumption is invalid and discusses control charts for profile monitoring. All computations in the examples are solved using R, with R functions and datasets available for download on the author’s website.   Offering a systematic description of both traditional and newer SPC methods, this book is ideal as a primary textbook for a one-semester course in disciplines concerned with process quality control, such as statistics, industrial and systems engineering, and management sciences. It can also be used as a supplemental textbook for courses on quality improvement and system management. In addition, the book provides researchers with many useful, recent research results on SPC and gives quality control practitioners helpful guidelines on implementing up-to-date SPC techniques.},

It is designed to analyze and display extended structures of statistical process control data for various cases of grouping, reference distribution, and use of nominal specifications. For each group of observations, the scaled deviations from reference values are portrayed together as a modified profile plot symbol. The vertical location of the symbol is determined by the multivariate distance of the vector of means from the reference values. The graphical display in the MP chart enjoys improved visual characteristics as compared with previously suggested methods. Moreover, the perceptual tasks required by the use of the MP chart provide higher accuracy in retrieving the quantitative information. This graphical display is used to display other combined univariate and multivariate statistics, such as measures of dispersion, principal components, and cumulative sums},

Therefore, multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) methods have been developed, but traditional MSPC methods cannot detect faults relating to process variables that are difficult to measure online. In this work, a new MSPC method including soft sensor prediction is proposed to solve this problem. Soft sensors predict values of difficult-to-measure variables that are used as input variables of fault detection models. The proposed method enables the real-time control of processes using difficult-to-measure variables. The fault detection performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and compared with that of traditional MSPC methods using the Tennessee Eastman process and real industrial process data sets. The results show that the proposed method can achieve more accurate and earlier fault detection than traditional MSPC methods.},

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

	abstract = {Let \{Xn,n=0,±1,⋯\}{\textbackslash}\{X\_n, n = 0, {\textbackslash}pm 1, {\textbackslash}cdots{\textbackslash}\} be a real valued discrete parameter stationary stochastic process on a probability space (Ω,ℱ,P);({\textbackslash}Omega, {\textbackslash}mathscr\{F\}, P); for each n=1,2,⋯n = 1, 2, {\textbackslash}cdots, let Zn=max(X1,⋯,Xn)Z\_n = {\textbackslash}max (X\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, X\_n). We shall find general conditions under which the random variable ZnZ\_n has a limiting distribution function (d.f.) as n→∞n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty; that is, there exist sequences \{an\}{\textbackslash}\{a\_n{\textbackslash}\} and \{bn\},an{\textgreater}0{\textbackslash}\{b\_n{\textbackslash}\}, a\_n {\textgreater} 0, and a proper nondegenerate d.f. Φ(x){\textbackslash}Phi(x) such that limn→∞P\{Zn≦anx+bn\}=Φ(x)(1.1){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{1.1\}{\textbackslash}lim\_\{n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\} P{\textbackslash}\{Z\_n {\textbackslash}leqq a\_nx + b\_n{\textbackslash}\} = {\textbackslash}Phi(x){\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} for each xx in the continuity set of Φ(x){\textbackslash}Phi(x). The simplest type of stationary sequence \{Xn\}{\textbackslash}\{X\_n{\textbackslash}\} is one in which the random variables are mutually independent with some common d.f. F(x)F(x). In this case, ZnZ\_n has the d.f. Fn(x)F{\textasciicircum}n(x) and (1.1) becomes limn→∞Fn(anx+bn)=Φ(x).(1.2){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{1.2\}{\textbackslash}lim\_\{n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\} F{\textasciicircum}n(a\_nx + b\_n) = {\textbackslash}Phi(x).{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} It is well known that in (1.2) Φ(x){\textbackslash}Phi(x) is of one of exactly three types; necessary and sufficient conditions on FF for the validity of (1.2) are also known [9]. The three types are usually called extreme value d.f.'s [10]. Theorem 2.1 gives the limiting d.f. of ZnZ\_n in a stationary sequence satisfying a certain condition on the upper tail of the conditional d.f. of X1X\_1, given the "past" of sequence: the limiting d.f. is a simple mixture of extreme value d.f.'s of a single type. These are the same kind of d.f.'s found by us [3] to be the limiting d.f.'s of maxima in sequences of exchangeable random variables. The conditions of Theorem 2.1 are specialized to exchangeable and Markov sequences, and Theorem 2.2 extends the methods of Theorem 2.1 to general (not necessarily stationary) Markov sequences. It is shown that stationary Gaussian sequences, except for the trivial case of independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables, do not obey the requirements of the hypothesis of Theorem 2.1: hence, Sections 3, 4, and 5 are devoted to a detailed study of the maximum in a stationary Gaussian sequence. Theorem 3.1 provides conditions on the rate of convergence of the covariance sequence to 0 which are sufficient for ZnZ\_n to have the same extreme value limiting d.f. as in the case of independence, namely, exp(−e−x){\textbackslash}exp (-e{\textasciicircum}\{-x\}). The relation of these conditions to the spectral d.f. of the process is also discussed. A weaker condition on the covariance sequence ensures the "relative stability in probability" of ZnZ\_n (Theorem 4.1). Theorem 5.1 describes the behavior of ZnZ\_n when the spectrum has a discrete component with "not too many large jumps" and a "smooth" continuous component: when properly normalized, ZnZ\_n converges in probability to a random variable representing the maximum of the process corresponding to the discrete spectral component. A special case was given by us in [2]. We now summarize some known results used in the sequel. The extreme value d.f.'s are continuous, so that (1.2) holds for all xx; furthermore, this holds if and only if it holds for all xx satisfying 0{\textless}Φ(x){\textless}1.0 {\textless} {\textbackslash}Phi(x) {\textless} 1. (1.2) implies that for all such xx 0{\textless}Fn(anx+bn){\textless}1,for all largen,0 {\textless} F{\textasciicircum}n (a\_nx + b\_n) {\textless} 1,{\textbackslash}quad{\textbackslash}text\{for all large\} n, and limn→∞F(anx+bn)=1.(1.3){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{1.3\}{\textbackslash}lim\_\{n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\} F(a\_nx + b\_n) = 1.{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} Let x∞x\_{\textbackslash}infty be the supremum of all real numbers x′x' for which F(x′){\textless}1F(x') {\textless} 1; then, for all xx satisfying 0{\textless}Φ(x){\textless}10 {\textless} {\textbackslash}Phi(x) {\textless} 1, we have limn→∞anx+bn=x∞.(1.4){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{1.4\}{\textbackslash}lim\_\{n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\} a\_nx + b\_n = x\_{\textbackslash}infty.{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} From (1.3), and the asymptotic relation −logF∼(1−F),F→1-{\textbackslash}log F {\textbackslash}sim (1 - F), F {\textbackslash}rightarrow 1, we see that (1.2) holds if and only if limn→∞n[1−F(anx+bn)]=−logΦ(x).(1.5){\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\}{\textbackslash}tag\{1.5\}{\textbackslash}lim\_\{n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\} n{\textbackslash}lbrack 1 - F (a\_nx + b\_n){\textbackslash}rbrack = -{\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}Phi(x).{\textbackslash}end\{equation*\}},
