\chapter{Reliability Analysis}
\chaptermark{Reliability}

This chapter is adapted from \cite{natrella_nist/sematech_2010} and German Rodriguez's Generalized-Linear-Models class notes\footnote{\url{http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/notes/c7.pdf}.}.

The attempt to define the difference between \emph{reliability} and \emph{quality} will certainly fail, since given the intentional ambiguity in our definition of quality (Chapter~\ref{sec:introduction}).
For our purposes, however, this terminological matter will not bother us, since we will simply define reliability analysis to be the analysis of the \emph{time} to \emph{failure}.
We will also assume that ``time'' and ``failure'' are well defined and agreed upon.

We intuitively understand ``more reliable'' to mean ``lasts longer''. 
We should also consider, however, the case of a product that is designed to fail after some time, thus forcing the consumer to buy a new one. 
Some may say that a major hi-tech company named after a fruit employs this practice. 
Be it true or not, I hope we can agree that good knowledge of your product's life expectancy is a desirable.

\section{Terminology}
As usual we start with terminology.
It should be noted that reliability theory actually began with 19th century insurance companies, where is is known as \emph{survival analysis}.\marginnote{Survival Analysis}
In economics it is known as \emph{duration analysis}, and \emph{event history analysis} in sociology. 
This is why the terminology may sometimes seem ill-suited for services and products.
