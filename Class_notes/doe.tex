Compiled from \cite{natrella_nist/sematech_2010}.

\subsection{Major Terminology}

%Block. Group of homogeneous experimental units.
%Confounding. One or more effects that cannot unambiguously be attributed to
%a single factor or interaction.
%Covariate. An uncontrollable variable that influences the response but is
%unaffected by any other experimental factors.
%Design (layout). Complete specification of experimental test runs, including
%blocking, randomization, repeat tests, replication, and the assignment of
%factor–level combinations to experimental units.
%Effect. Change in the average response between two factor–level
%combinations or between two experimental conditions.
%Experimental region (factor space). All possible factor–level combinations
%for which experimentation is possible.
%Factor. A controllable experimental variable that is thought to influence the
%response.
%Homogeneous experimental units. Units that are as uniform as possible on
%all characteristics that could affect the response.
%Interaction. Existence of joint factor effects in which the effect of each factor
%depends on the levels of the other factors.
%Level. Specific value of a factor.
%Repeat tests. Two or more observations that have the same levels for all the
%factors.
%Replication. Repetition of an entire experiment or a portion of an experiment
%under two or more sets of conditions.
%Response. Outcome or result of an experiment.
%Test run. Single combination of factor levels that yields an observation on the
%response.
%Unit (item). Entity on which a measurement or an observation is made;
%sometimes refers to the actual measurement or observation.



\begin{description}
\item [Alias] When the estimate of an effect also includes the influence of one or more other effects (usually high order interactions) the effects are said to be aliased.
\item [Balanced Design] An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.
\item [Blocking] A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. Note: the reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.
\item [Factor Encodings] Transforming the scale of measurement for a factor. 
Two level factor encodings include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Effect coding: where levels are encoded with $-1,1$ returning orthogonal design matrices for balanced designs.
\item Dummy coding: where levels are encoded with $0,1$ returning easily interpretable coefficients.
\end{itemize}
