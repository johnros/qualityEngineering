\chapter[DOE]{Design of Experiments - DOE}

This chapter is devoted to the matter of designing experiments.
A control chart may be seen as an on-line running experiment alerting us when things go sour. W
When designing a product (remember DFSS \ref{sec:dfss}), or one a control chart has signalled an alert, we will want to know what influences our production.
In our SPC terminology, we will want to know what are the \emph{causal} \emph{effect} of our \emph{controllable inputs}, or \emph{factors} influence our CTQ, or \emph{response}. 
The theory of discovering these effects is the theory of \emph{design of experiments} (DOE).



\begin{remark}[Data Analysis]
In this text, we only discuss the \textbf{design} of the experiment, and not the \textbf{analysis} of the data.
This is a non-standard choice as DOE is typically presented alongside the \emph{analysis of variance} (ANOVA) analysis framework.\marginnote{ANOVA}
We decouple the two since: 
(a) these are two different things, and 
(b) the language of ANOVA may be replaced, and has indeed been in many contexts, by the language of \emph{linear models}.
There is a vast literature on analysis methods. 
If asked, this author may recommend \cite{hocking_analysis_1985}, which presents both the ANOVA terminology, and the linear models terminology.
That book, however, may be hard to come by, in which case, I also recommend \cite{mason_statistical_2003}.

Before we dig in, two matters should be emphasized:
\begin{description}
\item [Randomization] Randomization is an essential 
\item [Pr-experiment]
\end{description}


\section{Terminology}
Compiled from \cite{mason_statistical_2003}.
Many, if not most of the following terms, originate in R.A. Fisher's seminal book ``The Design of Experiments'' \citep{fisher_design_1960}.
As usual, when old ideas get new names, we try to emphasize this in the text.

\begin{description}

\item [Experimental Unit]  Entity on which a measurement or an observation is made;
sometimes refers to the actual measurement or observation.
\item [Homogenous Experimental Unit] Units that are as uniform as possible on all characteristics that could affect the response.

\item [Factors]  A controllable experimental variable that is thought to influence the response. In the language of SPC: \emph{a controllable input}.

\item [Level] Specific value of a factor.

\item [Factor Encodings] The numerical encoding of factor levels.
Two level factor encodings include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Effect coding: where levels are encoded with $-1,1$ returning orthogonal design matrices for balanced designs.
\item Dummy coding: where levels are encoded with $0,1$ returning easily interpretable coefficients.
\end{enumerate}

\item [Experimental Region] All possible factor–level combinations for which experimentation is possible. \Aka \emph{factor space}.

\item [Design Matrix] A matrix description of an experiment that is useful for constructing and analyzing experiments.

\item [Response] The CTQ.

\item [Main Effect] Change in the expected response between two factor–levels.  

\item [Interaction] Existence of joint factor effects in which the effect of each factor depends on the levels of the other factors.

\item [Replication] Repetition of an entire experiment or a portion of an experiment
under two or more sets of conditions.

\item [Covariate]  An uncontrollable variable that influences the response but is
unaffected by any other experimental factors.

\item [Design]  Complete specification of experimental test runs, including blocking, randomization, repeat tests, replication, and the assignment of factor–level combinations to experimental units.

\item [Balanced Design] An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.

\item [Block] Group of homogeneous experimental units.

\item [Confounding] When the design is such that several effects cannot be told apart. \Aka \emph{aliasing}.

\item [Repeat Tests] Two or more observations that have the same levels for all the
factors.
