\begin{description}
\item [Alias] When the estimate of an effect also includes the influence of one or more other effects (usually high order interactions) the effects are said to be aliased.
\item [Balanced Design] An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.
\item [Blocking] A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. Note: the reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.
\item [Factor Encodings] Transforming the scale of measurement for a factor. 
Two level factor encodings include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Effect coding: where levels are encoded with $-1,1$ returning orthogonal design matrices for balanced designs.
\item Dummy coding: where levels are encoded with $0,1$ returning easily interpretable coefficients.
