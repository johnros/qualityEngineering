\section{Bibliographic Notes}
For an overview of DOE see \cite{cox_theory_2000}, \cite{mason_statistical_2003}, \cite{everitt_cambridge_2010}. 
Another nice and freely available resource is a Penn State course on the topic\footnote{\url{https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat503/node/1}}. 
Some seminal references in the field include \cite{fisher_design_1960} and \cite{box_statistics_1978}.
For respondent driven sampling see \cite{berchenko_modeling_2013}.
For causal inference in non-designed experiments see \cite{rosenbaum_observational_2002}. 
For optimal designs see \cite{pukelsheim_optimal_1993}.
For analysis of data: linear models, ANOVA, etc.\ there are endlessly many books. This author's recommendations include \cite{hocking_analysis_1985}, \cite{greene_econometric_2003}. 
For the relation between factorial designs and coding theory in computer science, see \cite{hill_first_1986}. 
For design and analysis of computer experiments, see \cite{sacks_design_1989} or \cite{santner_design_2013}.
