\chapter[SPC]{Statistical Process Control- SPC}
\label{sec:spc}

Statistical process control (SPC), \aka \emph{change detection}, or \emph{novelty detection}, deals with the quantitative analysis of a ``process'', which may be a production line, a service, or any other repeated operation.\marginnote{Change Detection}
As such, SPC may be found in the Analyze, Improve, and Control stages of the DMAIC cycle.
The purpose of the SPC, in the terms coined by Shewart, is to seperate the variability in the process into \emph{assignable} causes of variation and \emph{chance} causes of variation.\marginnote{Causes of variation}
These are also known as \emph{special} and \emph{common} causes of variation, respectively. 
A process is said to be in \emph{statistical control} if all its variation is attributable to chance causes.
If this is not the case, we call it \emph{out of control} and we will seek the assignable causes, so that we may reduce variability by removing them.


All the previously mentioned statistical tools may be called upon for this analysis. 
In the context of process control, a subset of tools has gained the nick-name ``The Magnificent Seven''. These include:
\begin{description}
\item Histogram and stem-and-leaf plot. As described in Chapter~\ref{sec:exploratory}.
\item Check Sheet. [TODO: add figure]
\item Pareto chart. An ordered bar plot of the events due to the various assignable variability causes. [TODO: add figure]
\item Cause-and-effect diagram. A visualization of candidate assignable variability causes. [TODO: add figure]
\item Defect concentration diagram. A visual inspection of the location of defects on the product. [TODO: add figure]
\item Scatter plot. As described in Chapter~\ref{sec:exploratory}.
\item Control chart. A powerful analysis tool to which we devote the rest of this chapter.

We demonstrate the concepts and utility of Control Charts with the simplest, yet most popular of them all, the \barxChart. 
The chart borrows its name from the fact that it is essentially a visualization of the time evolution of the average ($\bar{x}$) of the CTQ of a sample of products. 
The chart is also augmented with visual aids that help in determining if the process is \emph{in control}, i.e., if it is consistent with its own history. 
Process capability analysis may benefit from the ideas of control charts, as we explain in Chapter~\ref{sec:advanced_capability_analysis}.
We emphasize, again, that control charts have no information on the specifications of the process, merely on its own history.

An illustration of a \barxChart is given in Figure~\ref{fig:bar_x_chart}. 
The ingredients of this chart are the centerline, lower and upper control limits (LCL, UCL), and $\bar{x}$ evolving in time. 
If at each period $t=1,\dots,\tau$ we compute the average of $n$ samples, we denote $\bar{x}_t:=1/n \sum_{i=1}^n x_{it}$.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{art/X-chartExample}
\caption[\barxChart]{\barxChart. \newline \url{https://mvpprograms.com/help/P-mvpstats/spc/WhatAreControlCharts}}
\label{fig:bar_x_chart}
\end{figure}






Figure~\ref{fig:bar_x_chart} makes it evident \barxChart requires several design decisions.
A standard design decision is setting the center line as the grand average of the process: 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:centerline}
	\hat{\mu}_0=1/\tau \sum_{t=1}^\tau \bar{x}_t,
\end{align}
where $\mu_0$ denotes the in-control mean of the process. Notation follows from treating the in-control process as a null hypothesis.


If it is unclear to you, how may we compute the grand average of a process that is still evolving and has not finished, you are right! We thus introduce the ideas of \emph{Phase I} and \emph{Phase II}. \marginnote{Phase I/II}
Initially we assume the process it out of control, we identify and remove assignable causes of variation, until we are left with a ``well-behaved'' subset of data points. We call this Phase I, and we use it to initialize required quantities such as the centre line. 
Eq.(\ref{eq:centerline}) thus implies that in Phase I we were left with $\tau$ samples assumingly in statistical control.
After the chart has been calibrated, and major assignable sources of variability removed, we can finally start monitoring the process, known as Phase II.



Other design decisions to be made are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item UCL and LCL \footnote{Do not confuse with USL and LSL!}.
\item Sample size in each sample ($n$).
\item Rational groupings (within-period sampling scheme).
\item Frequency of samples (between-period sampling scheme). 
\item Other stopping rules.
\end{enumerate}
These design decisions ultimately govern the error rates of the chart, which in turn, incur financial costs. 
For now we will restrict attention to type I/II error rates, until Section~\ref{sec:economical_considerations} where we consider these choices as economical optimization problems.

For ease of exposition, control chart design is demonstrated for the \barxChart, but equally applies to other control charts, presented in Section~\ref{sec:other_control_charts}.
We start by a type I error rate analysis. 
Denote $\alpha_t$ the false alarm probability at period $t$.
How do our design choices affect $\alpha_t$?
\begin{align}
	\alpha_t &:= 1-P_{H_0}(\bar{x}_t \in [UCL,LCL]) \\
	&= 2 P_{H_0}(\bar{x}_t<UCL) \\
	&= 2 P_{H_0}(Z<\frac{UCL-\mu}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}) \\
	&= 2 P_{H_0}(Z < -\arm) \\
	&= 2 \Phi(-k)
\end{align}
The above follows from assuming that $UCL:=\mu + \arm \sigmabar, LCL:= \mu - \arm \sigmabar$, $\x_{it}\sim \gauss{\mu,\sigma^2}$, and denoting $\sigmabar:= \frac{\sigma}{n}$.
A typical design choice is $\arm=3$, known as \emph{3-sigma control limits}, implying a false alarm rate of $\alpha_t=0.0027$.\marginnote{3-Sigma Control Limits}
Since we assumed the process is fixed over time, then so is $\alpha_t$ and we can simply write $\alpha_t=\alpha$.

\begin{remark}[3-Sigma Control Limits vs. 3-Sigma Capability]
Do not confuse these two similar ideas.
3-Sigma Control Limits is a statement on the false alarm rate of a process with respect to its own \textbf{history}.
3-Sigma Capability is a statement on the non-compliance rate of a process with respect to its \textbf{specification}.
\end{remark}


A power analysis for our design choices follows the same lines.
Denote $\beta_t$, and $\pi_t=1-\beta_t$ the type II error rate, and power, at period $t$.
We then have
\begin{align}
	\pi_t &:= 1-P_{H_1}(\bar{x}_t \in [UCL,LCL])
\end{align}
and the rest follow from the distribution of $\bar{x}$ when the process is out of control.
Since the out-of-control shift is stable, we can again omit the time index and write $\pi=\pi_t$.
Assuming the out-of-control process is a shift of magnitude $k \sigma$, i.e.: $\x \sim \gauss{\mu_1,\sigma^2}; \mu_1=\mu_0+ k \sigma$, we plot in Figure~\ref{fig:power_function}, the detection power of a 3-sigma \barxChart, as a function of $k$. 
This is known in the statistical literature as a \emph{power function}, and in the engineering literature as the \emph{true positive rate} operator characteristic (TPR-OR).\marginnote{Operator Characteristic}


\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{art/power_function.pdf}
\caption[Power Function]{Power function of the 3-sigma \barxChart with $n=5,10,20$ and $\mu_1=\mu_0 + k \sigma$.}
\label{fig:power_function}
\end{figure}

\begin{extra}[Operator Characteristics]
Many operator characteristics have been proposed to study the performance of control charts, statistical tests, or binary classifiers in general.
You may be already familiar with some, such as the ROC-curve. 
The curious reader is referred to \cite{wikipedia_receiver_2015} for more information.
\end{extra}


Another important related quantity is the \emph{average run length} (ARL), which is the expected number of periods between two crossings of control limits, i.e., the expected periods between alarms. \marginnote{ARL}
We denote by $ARL_0$ the ARL when the process is under statistical control, and $ARL_1$ otherwise\footnote{Note that it is implied that the process has a \emph{stable} distribution, even though it is out if control.}. 
If $\bar{x}_t$ are statistically independent, then clearly the number of periods until a crossing is geometrically distributed. Using the expectation of a geometric random variable we can conclude that 
\begin{align}
	ARL_0=1/\alpha \label{eq:arl_0}, \\
	ARL_1=1/\pi \label{eq:arl_1}.
\end{align}
Clearly we can convert to time units by multiplying the ARL by the duration of sampling interval.
This is known as the \emph{average time to signal} (ATS).\marginnote{ATS}
It is quite common to design a control chart so that it achieves a particular $ATS_0$.


Now assume that we are unhappy with some control chart. 
It simply makes too many false alarms, or takes too long to detect loss of statistical control.
What can we do about it?
Well, this is exactly the same question as when increasing the power or lowering the type I error of a statistical hypothesis test. This is obviously no coincidence, since control charts are nothing but a statistical test!
Here are some action courses:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increase $\arm$. This is the same as shrinking the rejection region: 
it will decrease the false alarm rate, at the cost of power.
\item Increase $n$. Brilliant! Statistically, there is nothing to lose. It may, however, cost time and money.
\item Increase the sampling frequency. Brilliant again! Nothing to lose, except time and money...
\item Change the sampling scheme within period. We elaborate on this in Section~\ref{sec:rational_grouping}.
\item Add other stopping rules: 
this acts just like growing the rejection region. It will increase power, at the cost of type I error. We elaborate in Section~\ref{sec:stopping_rules}.
\item Pool together more time points or more CTQs. We elaborate on this in sections \ref{sec:running_windows} and  \ref{sec:multivariate}, respectively. 
\end{enumerate}






\subsection{Control Limits and the Alarm Rate}
As previously discussed, $\arm$ governs the tradeoff between type I and type II errors, or sensitivity versus specificity.
It is very common to set $\arm=3$. 
For a Normally distributed CTQ, this implies $2,700$ false alarms per million periods. 
This also implies an $ARL_0$ of $1/\alpha \approx 370$ periods.
We may obviously, discard this $\arm=3$ convention, and directly set UCL and LCL so they guarantee some desirable false alarm rate. 

If normality of $\bar{x}_t$ can be assumed, then one may estimate $\sigma$ from phase I, and set LCL and UCL by finding the $\arm$ that solves $2\Phi(-\arm)=\alpha$.
If normality cannot be assumed, there are many ways to go about. Here are some options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increase $n$: even if $\x_it$ is non normal, for large enough $n$, then $\bar{x}_t$ will be via the central limit theorem (CLT).
\item Use empirical quantiles: If phase I was returned enough data, then we may estimate $\x_{\alpha/2}$ and $\x_{1-\alpha/2}$ using the empirical quantiles of phase I. The false alarm rate will be $\alpha$ since $P(\x \not \in [\x_{\alpha/2},\x_{1-\alpha/2}])=\alpha$.
\item If some other distribution can be assumed then we may compute the false alarm rate of particular limits either analytically, or computationally (by simulation).
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Rational Groupings}
\label{sec:rational_grouping}
Recall that at each period we compute the average of $n$ samples. 
How should we draw these samples? All at the same time from the same machine?
At different times from the same machine?
Many configurations are possible, and the correct approach depends on the type of out-of-control behaviour one seeks. 
\emph{Rational groupings} merely reminds us to sample ``rationally'' in each period. 
Quoting \cite{montgomery_introduction_2007}'s words of caution:
\begin{quotation}
\dots we can often make any process appear to be in statistical control just by stretching out the interval between observations in the sample.
\end{quotation}






\subsection{Other Stopping Rules}
\label{sec:stopping_rules}

The assumption that we may only create alarms if $\bar{x}$ exceeds some control limits is needlessly restrictive.
A first relaxation is by allowing multiple regions.
It is quite common to define \emph{warning limits} which only call for inspection, and \emph{action limits}. Each may have its own alarm rate.
We may even change the sapling scheme if limits are breached. Increasing the sampling rate once the warning limits have been breached is known as \emph{adaptive sampling}, or \emph{variable sampling}.\marginnote{Adaptive Sampling}



Another approach is to define multiple sets of stopping rules.
Here is an example:
\begin{enumerate}
\item One or more points outside of the 3-sigma control limits.
\item Two of three consecutive points outside the 2-sigma warning limits but still inside the 3-sigma control limits.
\item Four of five consecutive points beyond the 1-sigma limits.
\item A run of 8 consecutive points on one side of the center line.
\end{enumerate}
The above set of rules is known as the Western Electric Rules, \aka\, the \emph{WECO} rules.\marginnote{WECO}
Augmenting the set of rules is the same as increasing a rejection region. It adds more sensitivity, at the cost of false alarms. If the rules are properly selected, the gain in sensitivity is worth the increase in false alarms.

As a quick exercise, we may compute $\alpha$  for $m$ independent rules, each with $\alpha^*$ type I error itself:
\begin{align}
	\alpha=1-(1-\alpha^*)^m.
\end{align}
Having 4 rules, like WECO, each at $\alpha^*0.0027$ implies that we actually have $\alpha=0.01$.

\begin{extra}[Stopping Rules]
There are many sets of stopping rules. 
These include WECO, Nelson, AIAG, Juran, Hughes, Duncan, Gitlow, Westgard, and more. 
See \url{http://www.quinn-curtis.com/spcnamedrulesets.htm} for a quick introduction.

\section{Pooling Information Over Periods}
\label{sec:running_windows}

Assume an out-of-control process is simply a mild shift of the controlled-process.
This shift may be hard to detect in Shewart chart, especially if $n$ is not too large (as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:power_function}).  
If the shift persists, we may gain power, i.e., sensitivity, by pooling several periods together. 
We now present several ways to pool information from history. These are typically applied in Phase II, where out-of-control processes are expected to have only mild shifts, and not major ones as in Phase I. 

\begin{remark}[No longer Shewart]
The name \emph{Shewart control chart} is reserved to charts plotting one period at a time. 
When several periods are pooled together, we will no longer call this  ``Shewart''.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[One observation at a time]
The following charts have a continuous flavour. As such, it is both favourable, and common, to compute them using one observation at a time, and not by grouping, as is typically for Shewart charts. 
\end{remark}



\subsection{Run Test Chart}
[TODO]




\subsection{Moving Average Chart- MA}
One way to pool information from different periods is by a \emph{moving average}.
\begin{definition}[Moving Average- MA]
The moving average at period $t$ is defined as
\begin{align}
	M_t:= \frac{x_t+\dots+x_{t-w+1}}{w}
\end{align}
\end{definition}
Assuming $x_t \sim \gauss{\mu_0, \sigma_x^2}$ then clearly 
\begin{align}
	M_t \sim \gauss{\mu_0, \frac{\sigma_x^2}{w}}.
\end{align}

The control limits on $M_t$ are typically
\begin{align}
	UCL &:= \mu_0 + 3 \sigma_{M_t}= \mu_0 + 3 \, \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{w}} \\
	UCL &:= \mu_0 - 3 \sigma_{M_t}= \mu_0 - 3 \, \frac{\sigma_x}{\sqrt{w}}.
\end{align}
The fallout rate of this criterion is trivially $\alpha=0.0027$. 
The $ARL_0$ is no longer simple to compute. 
This is because the pooling of periods has compromised independence between periods, and Eqs.(\ref{eq:arl_0},\ref{eq:arl_1}) are no longer valid. 
Do not despair as the ARL may still be computed. 
You can always use simulation to compute it, or try using the \rcode{spc} \R package.


%\begin{algorithm}[$ARL_0$ simulation for MA Control Chart]
%\caption{$ARL_0$ simulation for MA Control Chart}
%\begin{algorithmic}
%\For {$\bootstrap \in 1,\dots,\bootstraps$}
%	\State $\sample^\bootstrap \gets$ $n$ randomly selected observations, with replacement, from the original data.

%\EndFor
%\State \Return the the average prediction for $x$ over $\estim{\hyp}^{\bootstrap}$ .
%\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}


We are free to choose the magnitude of $w$. 
If $w$ is too small, there is no real pooling from history. At the limit, where $w=1$, we are back to the classical Shewart chart. 
If $w$ is too large, then each new observation has very small importance, and it may take a long time to detect a shift.
Which is the right intermediate value of $w$, is left for you to decide.






\subsection{Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Chart- EWMA}
The moving average gives all observations the same importance. 
We want to change this, giving more importance to new observations so that we may capture drifts quickly when they occur. 
The \emph{Exponentially Weighted Moving Average} (EWMA), \aka the \emph{geometric moving average} (GMA), does just that. \marginnote{GMA}
\begin{definition}[Exponentially Weighted Moving Average- EWMA]
\begin{align}
	z_t &:= \lambda x_t + (1-\lambda) z_{t-1}
\end{align}
\end{definition}
By recursive substitution, we have 
\begin{align}
	z_t &:= \lambda \sum_{j=0}^{t-1} (1-\lambda)^j x_{t-j} + (1-\lambda)^t z_0,
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ewma_variance}
	z_t &\sim \gauss{\mu_0,	\sigma^2_{z_t} }, \\
	\sigma^2_{z_t} &= \sigma^2_x \left( \frac{\lambda}{2-\lambda} \right)(1-(1-\lambda)^{2t}).
\end{align}
Eq.(\ref{eq:ewma_variance}) may be used to construct control limits for EWMA:
It is however, more economic to observe that for large $\lambda$ and $t$: $(1-(1-\lambda)^{2t}) \approx 1$ so that we may use 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:ewma_variance_approximate}
	UCL &:= \mu_0 + 3 \sigma_{z_t} \approx \mu_0 + \arm \, \sqrt{\sigma^2_x\left( \frac{\lambda}{2-\lambda} \right)},  \\
	UCL &:= \mu_0 - 3 \sigma_{z_t} \approx \mu_0 - \arm \, \sqrt{\sigma^2_x\left( \frac{\lambda}{2-\lambda} \right)},
\end{split}
\end{align}
with $\arm=3$ being the typical choice.
By now, you should immediately know what is the fallout rate of these limits.
By now, you should also know that because of the dependence between $z_t$'s, computing the ARL is not as simple as for Shewart charts. The \rcode{xewma.arl()} \R function, in package \rcode{spc}, permits doing so easily. 
Its output for various $\lambda$ and $\arm$ is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:arl_0_ewma}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{art/fig53}
\caption[$ARL_0$ for EWMA]{$ARL_0$ for EWMA. \newline Code from \url{http://users.phhp.ufl.edu/pqiu/research/book/spc/r-codes/fig53.r}}
\label{fig:arl_0_ewma}
\end{figure}

Note that if we do not opt for the approximation in Eq.(\ref{eq:ewma_variance_approximate}), and use the exact Eq.(\ref{eq:ewma_variance}) then the alarm limits change over time. 


In the MA chart, we used the choice of $w$ to balance between quick response (small $w$) and sensitivity (large $w$).
EWMA has no window-width parameter, since it looks into all of history. On the other hand, we can control it by choosing $\lambda$. 
Large $\lambda$ gives more importance to the present. At the limit, $\lambda=1$, EWMA collapses to a standard Shewart chart.







\subsection{Filtered Derivative Chart}
[TODO]


\subsection{CUSUM Chart}
The \emph{cumulative sum} chart is similar to the EWMA in that it pools information from the history. 
The CUSUM simply sums all past deviations from the centre line.
If the process is in control, deviation will cancel each other, and their sum will vary around $0$. 
If the process is ot of control, a drift will appear. 
The statistic to be plotted is 
\begin{align}
	C_t:= \sum_{j=0}^{t}(x_j-\mu_0)=C_{t-1}+ (x_t-\mu_0)
\end{align} 
Observing that when under control then $C_t \sim \gauss{\mu_0, t \sigma_x^2}$, we could set 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:cusum_simple_limits}
\begin{split}
	UCL &:= \mu_0 + 3 \sigma_{C_t}= \mu_0 + \arm \, \sqrt{t \sigma_x^2},  \\
	UCL &:= \mu_0 - 3 \sigma_{C_t}= \mu_0 - \arm \, \sqrt{t \sigma_x^2}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
You may encounter these limits in your favourite software (\rcode{qcc} package in \R?), but it less often discussed in the literature. 
This is because CUSUMs were introduced by \cite{page_continuous_1954}, which offered different control limits. 
\cite{montgomery_introduction_2007} adopts \citeauthor{page_continuous_1954}'s view and presents limits in two forms: the \emph{decision interval} (DI) form, \aka the \emph{tabular} form, and the graphical form known as a \emph{V-mask}.
These two control limits are equivalent. Before we present them, we try to offer some intuition for the difference between the limits in Eq.(\ref{eq:cusum_simple_limits}) and those of \cite{page_continuous_1954}.

The fundamental difference between the control limits of \cite{page_continuous_1954}, and the ones presented until now, is that \citeauthor{page_continuous_1954} designed limits for the particular history of each process, while the limits until now, including Eq.(\ref{eq:cusum_simple_limits}) do not adapt to the particular history of the process.
As such, \citeauthor{page_continuous_1954}'s control limits are said to be \emph{adaptive}.\marginnote{Adaptive Contol Limits}

\section{Multivariate Control Charts}
\label{sec:multivariate}
% Wishart
% Srivastava Du
% PCA
% Higher criticism

Consider an intensive care unit. 
The CTQs are the patient's blood pressure, temperature, etc.
We want to sound an alarm if the patient's condition deteriorates. 
Clearly, we can apply previous the univariate methodology above. 
It is possible, that the deterioration is mild, so that it is not picked up by any CTQ individually (low power), but could have been noticed were we to aggregate signal from all CTQs. This is the concern of the current section. 

\subsection{The Mass Univariate Approach}
A first natural approach is to raise an alarm when \textbf{any} of the processes exceeds its respective control limits.
For $m$ independent processes, with false alarm rate $\alpha$ each, then the joint false alarm rate is 
\begin{align}
	\alpha^* = 1-(1-\alpha)^m.
\end{align}
Clearly we could set $\alpha=1-\sqrt[m]{1-\alpha^*}$, so that the joint false alarm rate is under control, but we would not be enjoying the added sensitivity of pooling many CTQs together. 



\subsection{Hotteling's \tsq}
Hotteling's \tsq statistic is a generalization of the t-test.
To see this we write the t-statistic in the following weird form:
\begin{align}
	t(x)=(\bar{x}_t-\mu_0) (s^2_t(x))^{-1} (\bar{x}_t-\mu_0).
\end{align}
This notation readily extends to the multivariate case. 
For $p$ CTQs, then $\bar{x}_t$ and $\mu_0$ are $p$-length vectors, and $s^2_t(x)$ is replaced with the $p \times p$ matrix $\hat{\Sigma}_t(x)$:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:hotteling}
	T^2_t := n (\bar{x}_t-\hat{\mu}_0)' \hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1} (\bar{x}_t-\hat{\mu}_0).
\end{align}
To derive the control limits, we will be assuming that $\x_{it}$ is $p$-variate Gaussian distributed, $\gauss{\mu_0, \Sigma_{p \times p}}$. 
We need to be very clear, however, on how $\mu_0$ and $\hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1}$ are estimated. 
We thus consider the following scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \tsq is computed at Phase II with a single observation at a time ($n=1$)
\item $\mu_0,\hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1}$ were estimated from $m$ observations in Phase I.
\end{enumerate}
Eq.(\ref{eq:hotteling}) thus yields 
\begin{align}
	T^2_t := (x_t-\hat{\mu}_0)' \hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1} (x_t-\hat{\mu}_0).
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
	T^2_t \sim F_{p,m-p} \frac{p(m-1)(m+1)}{m(m-p)} \overset{m \to \infty}{\rightsquigarrow }\chi^2_p.
\end{align}
We can thus construct the control limit for this scenario:
\begin{align}
	UCL:= F_{1-\alpha,p,m-p} \frac{p(m-1)(m+1)}{m(m-p)} \approx \chi^2_{1-\alpha,p}.
\end{align}
Note that the \tsq statistic is \emph{non directional}: it will increase in the presence of both positive and negative drift. 

We may consider the distribution of \tsq under many configurations: where $\mu_0,\hat{\Sigma}_t^{-1}$ are estimated at Phase II, where we take $n$ observation in each period, etc. 
For our current purposes, we will use the fact that if $n \gg p$, or $m \gg p$, then 
\begin{align}
	T^2_t  \rightsquigarrow \chi^2_p,
\end{align}
and thus
\begin{align}
	UCL \approx \chi^2_{1-\alpha,p}.
\end{align}


For exact results and references on these scenarios, we refer the reader to \cite[Ch.7]{qiu_introduction_2013}.
